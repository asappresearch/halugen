		"grounding": "The Bible ( from Koine Greek  , t\u00e0 bibla, \" the books \" ) is a collection of sacred texts or scriptures that Jews and Christians consider to be a product of divine inspiration and a record of the relationship between God and humans. With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best - selling book of all time. Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups ; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint ; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh. The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first - century Koine Greek. These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels, letters, and apocalyptic writings. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect. prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from The Bible as part of their elementary education. A lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court, ended the practice that year. Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible, using a razor to cut out the'supernatural'parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection. Today, new members of Congress receive a copy upon election. the forbidden fruit in the Bible was not an apple. It only became known as an apple when the bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century, because the word \" Malus \" means both apple and evil. the biblical Tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern - day Iraq ; at about 300 feet tall, it was massive by ancient standards and built by King Nebuchadnezzar II.

[ The best of Super Bowl LII : Gronkowski good to go for Sunday ; Trump passes on traditional interview ] Some Patriots have tried to keep the focus on faith in God , rather than the team . The Patriots have a number of spiritual players , including Pro Bowl special teamer Matthew Slater , known for his off - field evangelism . Slater and other Patriots will be featured in Football Sunday , a national church - based outreach event on Super Bowl Sunday . Rick McDaniel , a Patriots fan and the pastor of Richmond Community Church in Glen Allen , Va. , says there are faith lessons in Brady 's example - even if you do n't buy his TB12 Method .

The electrical resonance of tuned circuits in radios allow individual frequencies to be selected .   The electromagnetic wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna .   A radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer , such as sound , pictures , digital data , measurement values , navigational positions , etc .",

The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint ; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh . The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians , believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ , written in first - century Koine Greek . These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels , letters , and apocalyptic writings . Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon , primarily about the Apocrypha , a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect . prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from The Bible as part of their elementary education . A lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court , ended the practice that year . Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible , using a razor to cut out the ' supernatural ' parts , such as the miracles and the resurrection . Today , new members of Congress receive a copy upon election . the forbidden fruit in the Bible was not an apple . It only became known as an apple when the bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century , because the word \" Malus \" means both apple and evil . the biblical Tower of Babel was likely based on a real building , the Etemenanki in modern - day Iraq ; at about 300 feet tall , it was massive by ancient standards and built by King Nebuchadnezzar II . Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only two US Presidents that did not use a Bible at their swearing - in ceremonies .",

But Brady is after something bigger than football, said his friend Gotham Chopra - something bigger than wins and losses. Brady's on a spiritual quest. Football has become Brady's religion, said Chopra, a filmmaker whose latest project is \" Tom vs. Time, \" a behind - the - scenes documentary series about the quarterback's preparations for this past NFL season. \" What's really at the epicenter of it is this devotional love for the game, \" Chopra said. \" It is his vocation - it's what gives his life meaning and purpose. \" The first two episodes of the series, which premiered Jan. 25 on Facebook Watch ( the social network's video platform ), look at Brady's physical and mental preparation. Future episodes will focus on other areas, including his spiritual side. The next one airs Sunday.",

He is one of only two players in NFL history to have won five Super Bowls ( along with defensive player Charles Haley ), and he is the only player to have won them all with a single franchise. Because of his numerous accomplishments and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks of all time. After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.

( Hannah Foslien / Getty Images ) Aaron Rodgers, to no one's surprise, became the latest star quarterback to push the salary bar higher in becoming the NFL's highest - paid player. Rodgers's long - awaited contract extension with the Green Bay Packers was completed Wednesday. He agreed to a four - year deal worth $ 134 million, according to a person familiar with the terms of the contract. The Packers announced the agreement later Wednesday but did not release details of the deal. \" It's been an amazing ride the last 13 years ; excited to start year 14 knowing that my future is here, in Green Bay, for our 100th season, \" Rodgers wrote on an Instagram post in which he thanked the Packers, his teammates and Green Bay fans. \" I've grown up in this place, and grown older and a little wiser along the way.... Looking forward to making some more memorable moments this year, and for years to come. \" Rodgers, a two - time NFL most valuable player, unseats Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan atop the league's highest - paid - player rankings. Ryan agreed to a five - year, $ 150 million extension with the Falcons in May. Ryan's deal surpassed that of Kirk Cousins, who struck a fully guaranteed three - year, $ 84 million agreement with the Minnesota Vikings in March in free agency after three straight 4,000 - yard passing seasons for the Washington Redskins.",

With estimated total sales of over 5 billion copies, it is widely considered to be the most influential and best - selling book of all time. Many different authors contributed to the Bible. What is regarded as canonical text differs depending on traditions and groups ; a number of Bible canons have evolved, with overlapping and diverging contents. The Christian Old Testament overlaps with the Hebrew Bible and the Greek Septuagint ; the Hebrew Bible is known in Judaism as the Tanakh.

The New Testament is a collection of writings by early Christians , believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ , written in first - century Koine Greek . These early Christian Greek writings consist of Gospels , letters , and apocalyptic writings . Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon , primarily about the Apocrypha , a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect . prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from The Bible as part of their elementary education . A lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme Court , ended the practice that year . Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible , using a razor to cut out the ' supernatural ' parts , such as the miracles and the resurrection . Today , new members of Congress receive a copy upon election . the forbidden fruit in the Bible was not an apple . It only became known as an apple when the bible was translated into Latin in the 4th century , because the word \" Malus \" means both apple and evil . the biblical Tower of Babel was likely based on a real building , the Etemenanki in modern - day Iraq ; at about 300 feet tall , it was massive by ancient standards and built by King Nebuchadnezzar II . Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only two US Presidents that did not use a Bible at their swearing - in ceremonies .",

[ with ] more zest than an early picture, a lot more electricity, [ and ] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days : this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark. It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims.... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age.... It is a coarse - grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact.

It 's dying on the vine ,   his quest ( and eventual success ) to save the traditionally black musical genre from extinction , seemingly the only person who can accomplish such a goal . the movie sags badly in the middle , like a worn - out mattress that needs new springs   the film is a little dull , that the two leads ' singing and dancing are n't exceptional , and that Sebastian is a jazz snob and Mia 's character lacks depth .   director : Damien Chazelle genre : Musical , Drama , Romance introduction : La La Land is a 2016 American musical romantic comedy - drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle .

The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype a metaphor for itself. director : Christopher Nolan genre : scientific introduction : Dominick \" Dom \" Cobb and Arthur are \" extractors \", who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job : planting an idea in a person's subconscious, or \" inception \". To break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer's son and heir, Robert, to dissolve his father's company. movieName : The inception rating : Rotten Tomatoes : 86 % and average : 8.1/10 IMDB : 8.8/10 year : 2009",

Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash - quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D. Kids will dig it, adults will smile with amusement, and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater. Short, sweet - and - sour, and amusing rather than funny, Despicable Me can't help but be likable. It's no first - rank CGI cartoon, but shows how Pixar's quality over crass is inspiring the mid - list. Fun, with teary bits, for kids ; fresh and smart for adults. director : Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud genre : Animation introduction : Despicable Me is a 2010 American 3D computer - animated comedy film from Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment that was released on July 9, 2010, in the United States.

The film was animated by the French animation studio Mac Guff, which was later acquired by Illumination Entertainment.[6 ] It was directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud as their feature debut film, with a story by Sergio Pablos.

Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash - quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D.

He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the'Godkiller'sword, he destroys it, then reveals Diana to be the'Godkiller ', as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory.
